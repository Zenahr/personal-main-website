Since I keep getting messages from every direction about this, I figured I'd make a post.

Jagex has bought Ace of Spades and has shut down their master server. Spadille 1.5.1 (latest public release) used their master server and is therefor broken.

**I will be updating this when I get the chance.**

I will also likely be making a post regarding Ace of Spades 1.0, Jagex, and all that jazz.

For the time being, please visit our alternative community [Build and Shoot](http://www.buildandshoot.com/). I have reverse-engineered the master server protocol and created a new one, along with creating a new, open-source game server called [PySnip](http://www.buildandshoot.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;p=3293) [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/pysnip/). We have a serverlist set up [here(http://www.buildandshoot.com/serverlist)here, where you can join servers just as you always have.
