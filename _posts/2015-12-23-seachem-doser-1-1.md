So I'm about 8 months late to posting this. Granted, I'm quite behind on posting a lot of developments (sleep deprivation puns). Anyway, Seachem Doser is an Android app that I developed a while ago that serves as a "dosage/quantity calculator" for various products Seachem offers.

Seachem, for those who don't know/have lives, is a company that offers various products geared towards maintaining freshwater and marine aquariums. Personally, I use a lot of their products for my high-tech planted aquariums.

They offer calculators on their site that allow you to calculate how much you should dose specific fertilizers, buffers, conditioners, the amount of gravel needed per a specific volume, etc. Sadly, these calculators are all Flash-based. So I decided to make one that's a bit more flexible. I should note that all of the values for these calculations were pulled from their official calculators, after a bit of reverse-engineering. At first I just made a Windows-based calculator/library that you can find on [GitHub](https://github.com/NateShoffner/Seachem). Eventually the issue of convenience took hold and I decided to make it mobile.

As of today, I just updated it to work on tablets and polished things up a bit since I had some free time.

As with the Windows version, the Android version is also open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/NateShoffner/Seachem-Doser).

If you happen to be somebody who will find it useful, feel free to download it through the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nateshoffner.seachemdoser).
