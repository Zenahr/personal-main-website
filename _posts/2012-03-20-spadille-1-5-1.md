Just released a small patch for Spadille. Fixes some bugs listed below:

- Fixed serverlist parsing bug (due to updated serverlist format)
- Fixed bug with not being able to change server log directory
- Fixed some bugs with third-party game modes
- Fixed bug with ping filter not properly being applied
- Fixed bug when refreshing with favorites/recent tab open showing incorrect numbers
- Fixed bug with sliders not updating interface in game settings

Either re-download from the [projects](/projects/) page, or start Spadille and use the included updater.
